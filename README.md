# GROUTE: Intelligent EV Route Energy Assistant 🚗⚡

**GROUTE** is a smart, chat-based navigation assistant designed to help electric vehicle (EV) drivers **predict energy consumption**, plan charging stops, and select the most **battery-efficient routes**. By combining machine learning with Google Maps APIs, GROUTE tackles range anxiety and makes EV trip planning data-driven and reliable.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Electric vehicle drivers lack reliable insights into how different routes impact energy consumption. Existing navigation systems treat EVs like conventional vehicles and ignore critical factors such as:

* Road gradients
* Temperature
* Traffic conditions
* Driving speed

This leads to **uncertainty in trip planning**, inaccurate range expectations, and increased **range anxiety**, as drivers are unsure whether their battery will last the journey or if charging stops will be needed.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Understand the challenges of EV route planning, including range anxiety, charging availability, and energy variability.
* Analyze real-world route parameters (distance, slope, speed, traffic, temperature) and their impact on EV energy consumption.
* Explore supervised machine learning techniques for predicting energy usage based on vehicle and environmental features.
* Integrate multiple Google Maps APIs (Directions, Geocoding, Places) to fetch real-time routing and charging station data.
* Develop a multi-step energy estimation pipeline, including polyline decoding, coordinate processing, and SOC tracking.
* Design a user-friendly chat-based interface to collect trip details and deliver intelligent route and charging suggestions.
* Visualize multi-route comparisons using interactive maps and geospatial tools.
* Build an end-to-end intelligent EV assistant capable of recommending the most energy-efficient route.

## 🛠️ Methodology

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

* EV drivers lack route-wise energy insights, causing range anxiety and inefficient trips.

**Step 2: Data Collection & Feature Engineering**

* Extracted route distances, elevation, temperature, traffic, slope, and speed.
* Engineered features: energy consumption per km, SOC drop, traffic factor.

**Step 3: Model Training**

* Trained an ML regression model (Random Forest) to estimate energy consumption per route segment.
* Saved the model for real-time predictions using Joblib.

**Step 4: Route Evaluation Engine**

* Fetched multiple route options using Google Directions API.
* Calculated step-wise energy consumption using the trained model.

**Step 5: Best Route Selection**

* Compared all possible routes based on energy usage.
* Selected the most energy-efficient route.

**Step 6: Charging Station Logic**

* Tracked SOC throughout the journey.
* When SOC predicted to drop below 15%, located nearest EV charging station and marked it on the map.

**Step 7: Frontend Integration (GROUTE Chatbot)**

* Created a chat-driven assistant using Streamlit.
* Users provide start point, destination, SOC, and battery details.
* Chatbot displays maps, tables, efficiency metrics, and insights.
